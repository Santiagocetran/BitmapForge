# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is BitmapForge

BitmapForge is a client-side web app that converts 3D models (STL, OBJ, GLTF/GLB) into bitmap/dithered animations. Users upload a model, configure rendering settings (pixel size, dithering, color palette), choose animation presets, and export as GIF, video, sprite sheet, or code. No backend — everything runs in the browser.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` — Production build to `dist/`
- `npm run preview` — Preview production build

No test framework or linter is configured.

## Architecture

### Two-layer structure: `src/engine/` and `src/app/`

**`src/engine/`** — Framework-agnostic rendering engine (vanilla JS, no React):

- `SceneManager.js` — Orchestrates Three.js scene, camera, lights, renderer, and the BitmapEffect. Entry point for the engine. Manages model loading, animation loop, and settings updates.
- `effects/BaseEffect.js` — Shared logic: particle system, easing, color interpolation, brightness calculation.
- `effects/BitmapEffect.js` — Core visual engine. Reads WebGL pixels → calculates brightness per grid cell → applies dithering → maps brightness to colors → draws to visible canvas.
- `loaders/modelLoader.js` — Unified loader that auto-detects format by extension (STL/OBJ/GLTF/GLB).
- `animation/AnimationEngine.js` — Configurable animation orchestrator replacing hardcoded rotation. Driven by preset configs.
- `animation/presets.js` — Animation preset definitions (spinY, spinX, spinZ, float, fadeInOut).

**`src/app/`** — React application layer:

- `store/useProjectStore.js` — Zustand store holding all project state (model, colors, pixel size, dither type, animation settings, light direction). Every UI control reads/writes from this store.
- `hooks/useAutoSave.js` — localStorage persistence on every state change.
- `hooks/useExport.js` — Export logic (GIF via gif.js, video via MediaRecorder, sprite sheet, code ZIP via JSZip).
- `components/PreviewCanvas/` — Bridges React ↔ engine: instantiates SceneManager, subscribes to store changes, drives live preview.
- `components/Layout/` — App shell with sidebar + preview area.
- Other components: `ModelUploader`, `ColorPalette`, `AnimationControls`, `QualitySettings`, `LightDirection`, `ExportPanel`.

### Rendering pipeline

Three.js renders 3D scene to hidden WebGL canvas → BitmapEffect reads pixels via getImageData → calculates brightness per grid cell → applies dithering (Bayer 4x4/8x8, variable dot) → maps brightness to color palette (index 0 = shadows, last = highlights) → draws to visible canvas. During fade phases, particles scatter/gather with eased animations.

### Legacy files (deleted)

The original npm package code (`src/animations/`, `src/effects/`, `src/react/`) has been removed. It is preserved in git history. The active engine code lives in `src/engine/`.

## Tech Stack

React 19, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS 4, Zustand (state), Three.js (3D), Radix UI (primitives), react-colorful (color picker), @dnd-kit (drag reorder), react-dropzone (file upload), gif.js (GIF export), JSZip (ZIP export), Lucide React (icons).

## Key Conventions

- Color palette is brightness-mapped: array index 0 = darkest/shadows, last = brightest/highlights. Users reorder colors to control which brightness zones get which color.
- All animations are looped (GIF-like). Animation presets are plain config objects.
- The engine and app layers are intentionally separated so the engine could be published as a standalone npm package.

## Lattice

> **MANDATORY: This project has Lattice initialized (`.lattice/` exists). You MUST use Lattice to track all work. Creating tasks, updating statuses, and following the workflow below is not optional — it is a hard requirement. Failure to track work in Lattice is a coordination failure: other agents and humans cannot see, build on, or trust untracked work. If you are about to write code and no Lattice task exists for it, stop and create one first.**

Lattice is file-based, event-sourced task tracking built for minds that think in tokens and act in tool calls. The `.lattice/` directory is the coordination state — it lives alongside the code, not behind an API.

### Creating Tasks (Non-Negotiable)

Before you plan, implement, or touch a single file — the task must exist in Lattice. This is the first thing you do when work arrives.

```
lattice create "<title>" --actor agent:<your-id>
```

**Create a task for:** Any work that will produce commits — features, bugs, refactors, cleanup, pivots.

**Skip task creation only when:** The work is a sub-step of a task you're already tracking (lint fixes within your feature, test adjustments from your change), pure research with no deliverable, or work explicitly scoped under an existing task.

When in doubt, create the task. A small task costs nothing. Lost visibility costs everything.

**Recurring observations become tasks.** If you observe the same issue in 2+ consecutive sessions or advances (e.g., a failing test, a lint warning, a flaky behavior), create a task for it. Agents are disciplined about tracking assigned work but not discovered work — this convention closes that gap. Create discovered issues at `needs_human` if they need scoping, or `backlog` if they're well-understood.

### Descriptions Carry Context

Descriptions tell _what_ and _why_. Plan files tell _how_.

- **Fully specified** (bug located, fix named, files identified): still go through `in_planning`, but the plan can be a single line (e.g., "Fix the typo on line 77"). Mark `complexity: low`.
- **Clear goal, open implementation**: go through `in_planning`. The agent figures out the approach and writes a substantive plan.
- **Decision context from conversations**: bake decisions and rationale into the description — without it, the next agent re-derives what was already decided.

### Status Transitions

Every transition is an immutable, attributed event. **The cardinal rule: update status BEFORE you start the work, not after.** If the board says `backlog` but you're actively working, the board is lying and every mind reading it makes decisions on false information.

```
lattice status <task> <status> --actor agent:<your-id>
```

```
backlog → in_planning → planned → in_progress → review → done
                                       ↕            ↕
                                    blocked      needs_human
```

**Transition discipline:**

- `in_planning` — before you open the first file to read. Then write the plan.
- `planned` — only after the plan file has real content.
- `in_progress` — before you write the first line of code.
- `review` — when implementation is complete, before review starts. Then actually review.
- `done` — only after a review has been performed and recorded.
- Spawning a sub-agent? Update status in the parent context first.

### Sub-Agent Execution Model

Each lifecycle stage gets its own sub-agent with fresh context. This is the default execution pattern — not a suggestion, not complexity-gated. Every task, every time.

**Why this matters:** When a planning agent writes a plan and a separate implementation agent reads it, the plan _must_ be clear and complete — there's no shared context to fall back on. This forces better plans. When a review agent reads the diff cold, it catches things the implementer's context-polluted mind would miss. The plan file and git diff are the handoff artifacts.

**The three sub-agents:**

| Stage         | Sub-agent does                                                      | Reads            | Produces                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Plan**      | Explore codebase, write plan, move to `planned`                     | Task description | Plan file                                        |
| **Implement** | Read plan, build it, test, commit, move to `review`                 | Plan file        | Committed code                                   |
| **Review**    | Read diff cold, review against acceptance criteria, record findings | Git diff + plan  | Review comment (`--role review`), move to `done` |

**The parent orchestrator** (the main agent session) manages the lifecycle:

1. Move the task to `in_planning` before spawning the planning sub-agent.
2. After the planner finishes, move to `in_progress` and spawn the implementation sub-agent.
3. After the implementer finishes, the review sub-agent runs independently.

Each sub-agent should use a distinct actor ID (e.g., `agent:claude-opus-4-planner`, `agent:claude-opus-4-impl`, `agent:claude-opus-4-reviewer`) so the event log shows who did what.

### The Planning Gate

The plan file lives at `.lattice/plans/<task_id>.md` — scaffolded on creation, empty until you fill it.

This is the **planning sub-agent's** job. Spawn a sub-agent whose sole purpose is to explore the codebase, understand the problem, and write the plan. It should:

1. Read the task description and any linked context.
2. Explore the relevant source files — understand existing patterns and constraints.
3. Write the plan to `.lattice/plans/<task_id>.md` — scope, approach, key files, acceptance criteria. For trivial tasks, a single sentence is fine. For substantial work, be thorough.
4. Move to `planned` only when the plan file reflects what it intends to build.

**The test:** If you moved to `planned` and the plan file is still empty scaffold, you didn't plan. Every task gets a plan — even trivial tasks get a one-line plan. The CLI enforces this: transitioning to `in_progress` is blocked when the plan is still scaffold.

### The Review Gate

Moving to `review` is a commitment to actually review the work.

This is the **review sub-agent's** job. Spawn a sub-agent with fresh context — it did NOT write the code and comes in cold. It should:

1. Read the plan file to understand what was supposed to be built.
2. Read the git diff to see what was actually built.
3. Run tests and linting to verify nothing is broken.
4. Compare the implementation against the plan's acceptance criteria.
5. Record findings with `lattice comment --role review` — what was reviewed, what was found, and whether it meets acceptance criteria.

**When moving to `done`:** If the completion policy blocks you for a missing review artifact, do the review. Do not `--force` past it. `--force --reason` is for genuinely exceptional cases, not a convenience shortcut.

**The test:** If the same agent that wrote the code also reviewed it without a fresh context boundary, the review gate is not doing its job. The whole point is independent verification.

### Review Rework Loop

When a review agent evaluates work, it produces one of three outcomes:

1. **Pass (with optional minor fix):** The review agent uses vibes-based judgment. If the only issues are trivial (obvious typos, missing semicolons, etc.), fix them inline, record what was changed in the review comment, and move to `done`. No strict line-count threshold — the review agent decides.

2. **Fail — implementation-level:** The plan was sound but the implementation has issues. The review agent explicitly states "implementation-level rework needed" in its comment. The orchestrator transitions the task `review -> in_progress`. Critical findings from the review are appended to the plan file under a new `## Review Cycle N Findings` section. A fresh sub-agent is encouraged (but not mandated) for the rework.

3. **Fail — plan-level:** The original plan was flawed — wrong approach, missing requirements, etc. The review agent explicitly states "plan-level rework needed" in its comment. The orchestrator transitions the task `review -> in_planning`. The plan gets reworked (not just amended), then back through the full lifecycle.

**Who decides what:**

| Decision                            | Who          | How                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Fix inline vs send back             | Review agent | Vibes-based judgment, recorded in review comment |
| Implementation-level vs plan-level  | Review agent | Explicitly stated in review comment              |
| Route to in_progress vs in_planning | Orchestrator | Follows review agent's recommendation            |
| Whether to spawn fresh sub-agent    | Orchestrator | Encouraged by convention, not enforced           |

**3-cycle safety valve:** After 3 review-to-rework transitions (any combination of `review -> in_progress` and `review -> in_planning`), the CLI blocks the 4th attempt. The error message instructs the agent to move the task to `needs_human` with a comment explaining the situation. The limit is configurable via `review_cycle_limit` in the workflow config (default: 3). Override with `--force --reason` for genuinely exceptional cases.

**Allowed lifecycle paths:**

```
Normal:       in_progress -> review -> done
Minor fix:    in_progress -> review -> (fix inline) -> done
1 impl rework: in_progress -> review -> in_progress -> review -> done
1 plan rework: in_progress -> review -> in_planning -> planned -> in_progress -> review -> done
Max cycles:   3 review->rework transitions, then CLI blocks -> needs_human
```

### When You're Stuck

Use `needs_human` when you need human decision, approval, or input. This is distinct from `blocked` (generic external dependency) — it creates a scannable queue.

```
lattice status <task> needs_human --actor agent:<your-id>
lattice comment <task> "Need: <what you need, in one line>" --actor agent:<your-id>
```

Use for: design decisions requiring human judgment, missing access/credentials, ambiguous requirements, approval gates. The comment is mandatory — explain what you need in seconds, not minutes. The human's queue should be scannable.

### Actor Attribution

Every operation requires `--actor`. Attribution follows authorship of the _decision_, not the keystroke.

- Agent decided autonomously → `agent:<id>`
- Human typed it directly → `human:<id>`
- Human meaningfully shaped the outcome → `human:<id>` (agent was the instrument)

When in doubt, credit the human.

### Branch Linking

Link feature branches to tasks: `lattice branch-link <task> <branch-name> --actor agent:<your-id>`. Auto-detection works when the branch contains the short code (e.g., `feat/LAT-42-login`), but explicit linking is preferred.

### Leave Breadcrumbs

You are not the last mind that will touch this work. Use `lattice comment` for what you tried, chose, and left undone. Use `plans/<task_id>.md` for structured plans and `notes/<task_id>.md` for working notes and context dumps. The record you leave is the only bridge to the next agent's context.

### Shared Worktree Discipline

Multiple agents may work in the same repository concurrently on different tasks. The `git status` snapshot from your session start goes stale the moment another agent commits.

**When you encounter unfamiliar changes** (unexpected files, diffs you didn't make, new commits on HEAD):

1. **Investigate first.** Check `git log` and `lattice list` to see if another task/agent is responsible.
2. **Ask "who made this?" before "this shouldn't be here."** The change is almost certainly another agent's legitimate work.
3. **Never revert, reset, or delete changes you can't attribute.** If you're unsure, leave them alone and ask the human.

This applies to uncommitted changes in the working tree, unexpected commits on the branch, and new files that weren't there when your session started. The instinct to "clean up" unfamiliar state is exactly wrong in a multi-agent worktree — it destroys a sibling agent's work.

### Where Learnings Go

When you discover something important about how this project works — a pattern, a gotcha, a convention — **do not save it to auto-memory**. Memory is per-session and per-user; future Lattice agents in other installations will never see it. Instead, add it to this project's `CLAUDE.md` (for project-specific conventions) or propose updating the Lattice template (for universal patterns that should ship with every `lattice init`). The goal: every future agent, in every future installation, benefits from what you learned.

### Quick Reference

```
lattice create "<title>" --actor agent:<id>
lattice status <task> <status> --actor agent:<id>
lattice assign <task> <actor> --actor agent:<id>
lattice comment <task> "<text>" --actor agent:<id>
lattice link <task> <type> <target> --actor agent:<id>
lattice branch-link <task> <branch> --actor agent:<id>
lattice next [--actor agent:<id>] [--claim]
lattice show <task>
lattice list
```

**Useful flags:**

- `--quiet` — prints only the task ID (scripting: `TASK=$(lattice create "..." --quiet)`)
- `--json` — structured output: `{"ok": true, "data": ...}` or `{"ok": false, "error": ...}`
- `lattice list --status in_progress` / `--assigned agent:<id>` / `--tag <tag>` — filters
- `lattice link <task> subtask_of|depends_on|blocks <target>` — task relationships

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **BitmapForge** (1798 symbols, 4337 relationships, 146 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/BitmapForge/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning                               | Action                |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| d=1   | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these     |
| d=2   | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps       | Should test           |
| d=3   | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive         | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource                                     | Use for                                  |

| `gitnexus://repo/BitmapForge/context`        | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/BitmapForge/clusters`       | All functional areas                     |
| `gitnexus://repo/BitmapForge/processes`      | All execution flows                      |
| `gitnexus://repo/BitmapForge/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace             |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before completing any code modification task, verify:

1. `gitnexus_impact` was run for all modified symbols
2. No HIGH/CRITICAL risk warnings were ignored
3. `gitnexus_detect_changes()` confirms changes match expected scope
4. All d=1 (WILL BREAK) dependents were updated

## Keeping the Index Fresh

After committing code changes, the GitNexus index becomes stale. Re-run analyze to update it:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

If the index previously included embeddings, preserve them by adding `--embeddings`:

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze --embeddings
```

To check whether embeddings exist, inspect `.gitnexus/meta.json` — the `stats.embeddings` field shows the count (0 means no embeddings). **Running analyze without `--embeddings` will delete any previously generated embeddings.**
