Branch: main
Commit: 08f773238cdc
Task: Review the implementation plan at docs/plans/app-fixes-plan.md for the BitmapForge React app layer (src/app/). Read the plan file and all source files it references. For each of the 28 findings: (1) validate before/after code snippets against actual source, (2) confirm or challenge priority and effort estimates, (3) flag regressions or missed edge cases, (4) identify gaps. Produce a verdict per finding (APPROVED / NEEDS REVISION / DISPUTED), a prioritized top-10 fix list, and a final overall recommendation for the implementation order.
Constraints: none
Worktree: dirty
